# Math4GameDev

## Overview
Mathematics is a fundamental tool in game development. It is used to model the physics of the game world, to create realistic graphics, to simulate the behavior of characters and objects, and to implement game mechanics. This repository contains code and notes on the application of mathematics in game development. The theoretical concepts and notes are presented in Jupyter Notebooks, while the code is implemented in Python.
